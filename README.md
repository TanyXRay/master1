## 1.Test code for Git
> easy for use 

##### In this code, you can see the use of the scanner class as well as the calculation of a simple formula 
- x = (a - b) * (c - d)
#### and the application of conditional operators:
- if
- else

## 2.Java Quick Sort method
##### Quicksort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms in existence and has algorithmic complexity. In this method, the task is divided into subtasks until there is an elementary unit. The same with the algorithm: the array is divided into several arrays, each of which is sorted separately and then combined into one array.
*Step-by-step description of how the quick sort algorithm works:*

- select a pivot from the array, the supporting element is the middle element,
- we divide the array into two subarrays: elements, less than the pivot one and elements, more than the pivot one,
- Recursively apply the sort to the two subarrays.
##### We specify two methods in the code: the quicksort method and the main method.
##### In the first case, we write the algorithm for calculating the pivot element, dividing into subarrays, call recursion to sort 2 parts.
##### In the second case, we specify the value of the array itself and print the already sorted values to the console.
> there are also other options for writing code, where specific values in the array are indicated, and not random numbers, with the use of additional conditions if-else
